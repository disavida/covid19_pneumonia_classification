# Covid-19 and Pneumonia Classification with Deep Learning

## Project description
This project is meant to support doctors with diagnosing illnesses that affect patients’ lungs. The data was obtained from [X-ray lung scans](https://www.kaggle.com/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset) with examples of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness. Using the Keras module, I created a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on a patient’s X-ray scan. Hopefully this project could help doctors with the challenge of deciphering X-ray scans by creating learning models that are as effective and interpretable as possible.
